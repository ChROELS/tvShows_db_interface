# tvShows_db_interface
Small project to learn mongoDb.

We have a pre-existing mongoDb database of tv shows named "mediasData", with a collection named "tvShows" of 240 documents.

I would like to create a user interface accessing it, in order to work on the topic of read operations.

Design-phase steps:

I have started to think about use cases. Then, I have try to translate them to noSQL queries. 
After that, I have tested these queries in the Shell. This helped me to bring more precision and accuracy to the use cases and queries. 
I considered on one hand the specificities of the database, like boundary values of some crucial fields, and on the other hand, I thought about how to improve the user experience.
Queries and scenarios gained in complexity.
Afterwards, I described in text the functionalities and made a first sketch of the front-end components for the intended interface.

Front-end:

Implementation follows my first sketched ideas from the design-phase and is based on what offers Bootstrap 4 as possibilities.

Work in progress...
